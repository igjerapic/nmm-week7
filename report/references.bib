  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study water-graphene systems, and the force field parameters are vital for the accuracy of simulation results. Herein, water-graphene non-bonded Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters were developed according to the experimental water contact angle (θ), and were further validated by the quantum-chemistry calculated water-graphene interaction energy (Eint). The LJ parameters were developed based on various water models, and were employed to simulated a large diversity of water-graphene systems (e.g. water nanodroplet (or one water molecule) on graphene, water slab-graphene interface, graphene nanochannel connected to a water reservoir, water confined in graphene nanochannel, etc.), with thorough comparison against LJ parameters derived from Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule. All these abundant data were studied in-depth to yield plenty of insights (some were rarely reported) that could be extended to other two-dimensional materials or systems, e.g. linear correlation of cos θ~∼~LJ parameter and the slope is also linear with the reciprocal of water’s surface tension, linear correlation of Eint~∼~density of the 1st water layer on graphene, correlation of Eint~∼~water molecules’ residue time on graphene, (roughly) linear correlation of water density inside graphene 2D nanochannel~∼~water’s diffusivity etc.},

  abstract = {Fracture and breakage of single crystals, particularly of silicon wafers, are multi-scale problems: the crack tip starts propagating on an atomic scale with the breaking of chemical bonds, forms crack fronts through the crystal on the micrometre scale and ends macroscopically in catastrophic wafer shattering. Total wafer breakage is a severe problem for the semiconductor industry, not only during handling but also during temperature treatments, leading to million-dollar costs per annum in a device production line. Knowledge of the relevant dynamics governing perfect cleavage along the 111 or 110 faces, and of the deflection into higher indexed \mkbibemph{hkl} faces of higher energy, is scarce due to the high velocity of the process. Imaging techniques are commonly limited to depicting only the state of a wafer before the crack and in the final state. This paper presents, for the first time, \mkbibemph{in situ} high-speed crack propagation under thermal stress, imaged simultaneously in direct transmission and diffraction X-ray imaging. It shows how the propagating crack tip and the related strain field can be tracked in the phase-contrast and diffracted images, respectively. Movies with a time resolution of microseconds per frame reveal that the strain and crack tip do not propagate continuously or at a constant speed. Jumps in the crack tip position indicate pinning of the crack tip for about 1–2ms followed by jumps faster than 2–6ms1, leading to a macroscopically observed average velocity of 0.028–0.055ms1. The presented results also give a proof of concept that the described X-ray technique is compatible with studying ultra-fast cracks up to the speed of sound.},

  abstract = {The melting temperature of ice Ih for several commonly used models of water (SPC, SPC/E,TIP3P,TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P) is obtained from computer simulations at p=1bar. Since the melting temperature of ice Ih for the TIP4P model is now known [E. Sanz, C. Vega, J. L. F. Abascal, and L. G. MacDowell, Phys. Rev. Lett.\hphantom{,}92, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs–Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}98, 4149 (1993)] to evaluate the melting temperature of ice Ih for other potential models of water. We have found that the melting temperatures of ice Ih for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T=190K, 215K, 146K, 232K, 245K, and 274K, respectively. The relative stability of ice Ih with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice Ih is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice Ih is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H–O–H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the Ih and II ice forms. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate the effect upon a coexistence line due to a change in the potential parameters.}

  abstract = {It is very crucial to understand the fracture mechanism of the polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) on the molecular level. In this work, the effect of the shape and size of nanofillers on it has been investigated in details by adopting a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation. First, the fracture energy of PNCs is found to be much higher for rod fillers than for sheet fillers and sphere fillers. Then it is reduced with increasing the nanofiller size much faster for sphere fillers than for sheet fillers and rod fillers which results from their interface and network. To better understand it, the bond orientation degree is characterized which can reflect the elongation. By calculating the stress contribution of matrix chains and nanofillers, the stress borne by matrix chains gradually decreases with the increase of nanofiller size for sphere fillers and sheet fillers while it is nearly same for rod fillers. In addition, the stress borne by sphere filler is gradually reduced with the nanofiller size while it borne by rod fillers and sheet fillers rises. The former is closely related to the number of the interfacial beads which bear the high stress while the latter is attributed to the stress contribution by the bond/angle energy. Furthermore, the number of voids is quantified which first increases and then decreases with the strain which reflects the generation and coalescence of voids. Meanwhile, the voids prefer to nucleate in the matrix which is a weak region at the strong interfacial interaction. Last, the maximum number of voids gradually increases with the nanofiller size for sphere fillers and sheet fillers while it is nearly unchanged for rod fillers which is consistent with the matrix region. In summary, this work could provide a further understanding how the nanofiller shape affects the fracture properties of PNCs.},

  abstract = {The introduction of soft organic nanoparticles (NPs) into polymer melts has recently expanded the material design space for polymer nanocomposites, compared to traditional nanocomposites that utilize rigid NPs, such as silica, metallic NPs, and other inorganic NPs. Despite advances in the fabrication and characterization of this new class of materials, the effect of NP stiffness on the polymer structure and dynamics has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use molecular dynamics to investigate the segmental dynamics of the polymer interfacial region of isolated NPs of variable stiffness in a polymer matrix. When the NP–polymer interactions are stronger than the polymer–polymer interactions, we find that the slowing of segmental dynamics in the interfacial region is more pronounced for stiff NPs. In contrast, when the NP–polymer interaction strength is smaller than the matrix interaction, the NP stiffness has relatively little impact on the changes in the polymer interfacial dynamics. We also find that the segmental relaxation time τα of segments in the NP interfacial region changes from values lower than to higher than the bulk material when the NP–polymer interaction strength is increased beyond a “critical” strength, reminiscent of a binding–unbinding transition. Both the NP stiffness and the polymer–surface interaction strength can thus greatly influence the relative segmental relaxation and interfacial mobility in comparison to the bulk material.}
